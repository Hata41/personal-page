# About

This site presents my research activities, teaching, and publications.
It is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern static site generator,
and uses React components only when interactions are needed.

## Example of React Integration in MDX

You can embed React components in `.mdx` pages like this one:

<Counter client:load />

The counter above is a React component defined in `src/components/Counter.tsx`. The `client:load` directive
ensures it is hydrated on the client side.

## Additional Content

Feel free to create additional Markdown or MDX pages for your publications, conferences, course notes, etc.
