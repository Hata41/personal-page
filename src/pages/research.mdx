# Research

## Overview

My research focuses on **Reinforcement Learning for 3D Bin Packing with Masking Functions: Theory and Algorithms**. I investigate the use of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) enriched with invalid action masking to solve the NP-hard 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP). A key challenge is handling safety constraints (Safe RL) such as box stability, and managing large, factorized action spaces.

## Key Objectives

- Determining regret bounds for MDPs with masking functions.
- Developing new procedures based on invalid action masking for 3D-BPP.
- Integrating masking into Transfer Learning to handle domain shifts.
